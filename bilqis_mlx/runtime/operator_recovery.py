"""Operator-facing recovery policy for failures that survive domain self-healing.

The domain owner should repair, defer, retry, or regenerate a safe condition
before it reaches the CLI.  This module is the final translation layer for the
conditions that still require source repair or human action.  It never weakens
custody, source, semantic, or optimizer authority.
